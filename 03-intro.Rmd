## Why work with satellite image time series?{-}

Satellite images are the most comprehensive source of data about our environment.  Covering a large area of the Earth's surface, images allow researchers to study regional and global changes. Sensors capture data in multiple spectral bands to measure the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the Earth's surface. By observing the same location multiple times, satellites provide data on changes in the environment and survey areas that are difficult to observe from the ground. Given its unique features, images offer essential information for many applications, including deforestation, crop production, food security, urban footprints, water scarcity, and land degradation.

A time series is a set of data points collected at regular intervals over time. Time series data is used to analyze trends, patterns, and changes. Satellite image time series refer to time series obtained from a collection of images captured by a satellite over a period of time, typically months or years. Using time series, experts improve their understanding of ecological patterns and processes. Instead of selecting individual images from specific dates and comparing them, researchers track change continuously [@Woodcock2020]. 

## Time-first, space-later{-}

"Time-first, space-later" is a concept in satellite image classification that takes time series analysis as the first step for analyzing remote sensing data, with spatial information being considered after all time series are classified. The *time-first* part brings a better understanding of changes in landscapes. Detecting and tracking seasonal and long-term trends becomes feasible, as well as identifying anomalous events or patterns in the data, such as wildfires, floods, or droughts. Each pixel in a data cube is treated as a time series, using information available in the temporal instances of the case. Time series classification is pixel-based, producing a set of labelled pixels. This result is then used as input to the *space-later* part of the method. In this phase, a Bayesian smoothing algorithm that considers the spatial neighbourhood of each pixel improves the results of pixel-based classification.

## How `sits` works {.unnumbered}

The `sits` package uses satellite image time series for land classification, using  a *time-first, space-later* approach. In the data preparation part, collections of big Earth observation images are organized as data cubes. Each spatial location of a data cube is associated with a time series. Locations with known labels train a machine learning algorithm, which classifies all time series of a data cube, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:gview).

```{r gview, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", out.height = "70%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Using time series for land classification (Source: Authors)."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sits_general_view.png")
```

The package provides tools for analysis, visualization, and classification of satellite image time series. Users follow a typical workflow:

1.  Select an analysis-ready data image collection on cloud providers such as AWS, Microsoft Planetary Computer, Digital Earth Africa, or Brazil Data Cube.
2.  Build a regular data cube using the chosen image collection.
3.  Obtain new bands and indices with operations on data cubes.
4.  Extract time series samples from the data cube to be used as training data.
5.  Perform quality control and filtering on the time series samples.
6.  Train a machine learning model using the time series samples.
7.  Classify the data cube using the model to get class probabilities for each pixel.
8.  Post-process the probability cube to remove outliers.
9.  Produce a labeled map from the post-processed probability cube.
10. Evaluate the accuracy of the classification using best practices.

Each workflow step corresponds to a function of the `sits` API, as shown in the Table below and Figure \@ref(fig:api). These functions have convenient default parameters and behaviors. A single function builds machine learning (ML) models. The classification function processes big data cubes with efficient parallel processing. Since the `sits` API is simple to learn, users can achieve good results without in-depth knowledge about machine learning and parallel processing.

## Land use and land cover{-}

Since the main aim of `sits` is to support land use and land cover classification, this section presents a short discussion on the use of these terms. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization defines land cover as "the observed biophysical cover on the Earth's surface" [@DiGregorio2016]. Land cover can be observed and mapped directly through remote sensing images. In FAO's guidelines and reports, land use is described as "the human activities or purposes for which land is managed or exploited". FAO's land use classifications include classes such as cropland and pasture. Although *land cover* and *land use* denote different approaches for describing the Earth's landscape, in practice there is considerable overlap between these concepts [@Comber2008b]. When classifying remote sensing images, natural areas are classified using land cover types (e.g, forest), while human-modified areas are described with land use classes (e.g., pasture). 

One of the advantages of using image time series for land classification is its capacity of measuring changes in the landscape related to agricultural practices. For example, the time series of a vegetation index in an area used for crop production will show a pattern of minima (planting and sowing stages) and maxima (flowering stage). Thus, classification schemas based on image time series data can be richer and more detailed than those associated only with land cover. In what follows, we use the term "land classification" to refer to image classification that represents both land cover and land use classes.

## Classes and labels{-}

In this book, we distinguish between the concepts of "class" and "label". A class denotes a group of spatial objects that share similar land cover and land use types, such as urban areas, forests, water bodies, or agricultural fields. Classes are defined based on the specific application or study being conducted, and they help to analyse the vast amount of data obtained from remote sensing imagery. A label is the assignment or identification given to a specific feature or object within an image. Labels are markers that indicate to which class a particular pixel, segment, or object belongs. Labels are essential for supervised classification methods, where a training dataset with known labels is used to train a machine learning algorithm to recognize and classify new, unlabelled data. Thus, a "class" represents the overall category or group of features, while a "label" refers to the specific assignment of a class to a particular feature or object within an image. 

## Creating a data cube {.unnumbered}

There are two kinds of data cubes in `sits`: (a) irregular data cubes generated by selecting image collections on cloud providers such as AWS and Planetary Computer; (b) regular data cubes with images fully covering a chosen area, where each image has the same spectral bands and spatial resolution, and images follow a set of adjacent and regular time intervals. Machine learning applications need regular data cubes. Please refer to Chapter [Earth observation data cubes](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/earth-observation-data-cubes.html) for further details.

The first steps in using `sits` are: (a) select an analysis-ready data image collection available in a cloud provider or stored locally using `sits_cube()`; (b) if the collection is not regular, use `sits_regularize()` to build a regular data cube.

This section shows how to build a data cube from local images already organized as a regular data cube. The data cube is composed of MODIS MOD13Q1 images for the Sinop region in Mato Grosso, Brazil. All images have indexes NDVI and EVI covering a one-year period from 2013-09-14 to 2014-08-29 (we use "year-month-day" for dates). There are 23 time instances, each covering a 16-day period. The data is available in the R package `sitsdata`.

To build a data cube from local files, users must provide information about the original source from which the data was obtained. In this case, `sits_cube()` needs the parameters:

(a) `source`, the cloud provider from where the data has been obtained (in this case, the Brazil Data Cube "BDC");
(b) `collection`, the collection of the cloud provider from where the images have been extracted. In this case, data comes from the MOD13Q1 collection 6; 
(c) `data_dir`, the local directory where the image files are stored; 
(d) `parse_info`, a vector of strings stating how file names store information on "tile", "band", and "date". In this case, local images are stored in files whose names are similar to `TERRA_MODIS_012010_EVI_2014-07-28.tif`. This file represents a image obtained by the MODIS sensor onboard the TERRA satellite, covering part of tile 012010 in the EVI band for date 2014-07-28.

```{r, out.width = "100%", tidy="styler", fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="Color composite image MODIS cube for NDVI band in 2013-09-14 (Source: Authors)."}
# Create a data cube object based on the information about the files
sinop <- sits_cube(
  source = "BDC", 
  collection  = "MOD13Q1-6",
  data_dir = system.file("extdata/sinop", package = "sitsdata"),  
  parse_info = c("satellite", "sensor", "tile", "band", "date")
)
# select bands NDVI and EVI
sinop_2bands <- sits_select(sinop, bands = c("NDVI", "EVI"))
# Plot the NDVI for the first date (2013-09-14)
plot(sinop_2bands, 
     band = "NDVI", 
     dates = "2013-09-14",
     palette = "RdYlGn")
```

The aim of the `parse_info` parameter is to extract `tile`, `band` and `date` information from the file name. Given the large variation in image file names generated by different produces, it includes designators such as `X1` and `X2`; these are place holders for parts of the file name that is not relevant to `sits_cube()`. 

The R object returned by `sits_cube()` contains the metadata describing the contents of the data cube. It includes data source and collection, satellite, sensor, tile in the collection, bounding box, projection, and list of files. Each file refers to one band of an image at one of the temporal instances of the cube.

```{r}
# Show the R object that describes the data cube
sinop_2bands
```

## The time series tibble {-}

To handle time series information, `sits` uses a `tibble`. Tibbles are extensions of the `data.frame` tabular data structures provided by the `tidyverse` set of packages. The example below shows a time series tibble with 1,218 time series obtained from MODIS MOD13Q1 images. Each series has four attributes: two bands (NIR and MIR) and two indexes (NDVI and EVI). This data set is available in package `sitsdata`.

```{r}
# Load the MODIS samples for Mato Grosso from the "sitsdata" package
library(tibble)
library(sitsdata)
data("samples_matogrosso_mod13q1", package = "sitsdata")
samples_matogrosso_mod13q1[1:2,]
```

The time series tibble contains data and metadata. The first six columns contain the metadata: spatial and temporal information, the label assigned to the sample, and the data cube from where the data has been extracted. The `time_series` column contains the time series data for each spatiotemporal location. This data is also organized as a tibble, with a column with the dates and the other columns with the values for each spectral band. For more details on handling time series data, please see the Chapter [Working with time series](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/working-with-time-series.html).

It is helpful to plot the dispersion of the time series. In what follows, for brevity, we will filter only one label (Forest) and select one index (NDVI). Note that for filtering the label we use a function from `dplyr` package, while for selecting the index we use `sits_select()`.  The resulting plot shows all the time series associated with the label Forest and index NDVI, highlighting the median and the first and third quartiles.

```{r, out.width = "80%", tidy="styler", fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="Joint plot of all samples in band NDVI for label Forest (Source: Authors).", strip.white = FALSE}
samples_forest <- dplyr::filter(
    samples_matogrosso_mod13q1, 
    label == "Forest"
)
samples_forest_ndvi <- sits_select(
    samples_forest, 
    band = "NDVI"
)
plot(samples_forest_ndvi)
```

## Training a machine learning model {.unnumbered}

The next step is to train a machine learning (ML) model using `sits_train()`. It takes two inputs, `samples` (a time series table) and `ml_method` (a function that implements a machine learning algorithm). The result is a model that is used for classification. Each ML algorithm requires specific parameters that are user-controllable. For novice users, `sits` provides default parameters that produce good results. Please see Chapter [Machine learning for data cubes](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/machine-learning-for-data-cubes.html) for more details.

Since the time series data has four attributes (EVI, NDVI, NIR, and MIR) and the data cube images have only two, we select the NDVI and EVI values and use the resulting data for training. To build the classification model, we use a random forest model called by `sits_rfor()`.

```{r, out.width = "80%", tidy="styler", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Most relevant variables of trained random forest model (Source: Authors)."}
# Select the bands NDVI and EVI
samples_2bands <- sits_select(
    data = samples_matogrosso_mod13q1, 
    bands = c("NDVI", "EVI")
)
# Train a random forest model
rf_model <- sits_train(
    samples = samples_2bands, 
    ml_method = sits_rfor()
)
# Plot the most important variables of the model
plot(rf_model)
```

## Data cube classification {.unnumbered}

After training the machine learning model, the next step is to classify the data cube using `sits_classify()`. This function produces a set of raster probability maps, one for each class. For each of these maps, the value of a pixel is proportional to the probability that it belongs to the class. This function has two mandatory parameters: `data`, the data cube or time series tibble to be classified; and `ml_model`, the trained ML model. Optional parameters include: (a) `multicores`, number of cores to be used; (b) `memsize`, RAM used in the classification; (c) `output_dir`, the directory where the classified raster files will be written. Details of the classification process are available in "Image classification in data cubes".

```{r, out.width = "90%", tidy="styler", fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Probability map for class Forest (Source: Authors)."}
# Classify the raster image
sinop_probs <- sits_classify(
    data = sinop_2bands, 
    ml_model = rf_model,
    multicores = 2,
    memsize = 8,
    output_dir = "./tempdir/chp3"
)
# Plot the probability cube for class Forest
plot(sinop_probs, labels = "Forest", palette = "BuGn")
```

After completing the classification, we plot the probability maps for class Forest. Probability maps are helpful to visualize the degree of confidence the classifier assigns to the labels for each pixel. They can be used to produce uncertainty information and support active learning, as described in Chapter [Image classification in data cubes](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/image-classification-in-data-cubes.html).

## Spatial smoothing {.unnumbered}

When working with big Earth observation data, there is much variability in each class. As a result, some pixels will be misclassified. These errors are more likely to occur in transition areas between classes. To address these problems, `sits_smooth()` takes a probability cube as input and  uses the class probabilities of each pixel's neighborhood to reduce labeling uncertainty. Plotting the smoothed probability map for class Forest shows that most outliers have been removed.

```{r, out.width = "90%",  tidy="styler", fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Smoothed probability map for class Forest (Source: Authors)."}
# Perform spatial smoothing
sinop_bayes <- sits_smooth(
    cube = sinop_probs,
    multicores = 2,
    memsize = 8,
    output_dir = "./tempdir/chp3"
)
plot(sinop_bayes, labels = "Forest", palette = "Blues")
```

## Labeling a probability data cube {.unnumbered}

After removing outliers using local smoothing, the final classification map can be obtained using `sits_label_classification()`. This function assigns each pixel to the class with the highest probability.

```{r, out.width = "100%", tidy="styler", fig.cap = "Classification map for Sinop (Source: Authors).", fig.align="center"}
# Label the probability file 
sinop_map <- sits_label_classification(
    cube = sinop_bayes, 
    output_dir = "./tempdir/chp3"
)
plot(sinop_map, title = "Sinop Classification Map")
```

The resulting classification files can be read by QGIS. Links to the associated files are available in the `sinop_map` object in the nested table `file_info`.

```{r}
# Show the location of the classification file
sinop_map$file_info[[1]]
```

## Visualization of data cubes in interactive maps {.unnumbered}

In this chapter, we used `plot()` to produce a graphical display of data cubes, time series, and models. Data cubes and samples can also be shown as interactive maps using `sits_view()`. This function creates tiled overlays of different kinds of data cubes, allowing comparison between the original, intermediate and final results. It also includes background maps. The following example creates an interactive map combining the original data cube with the classified map.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = "styler"}
sits_view(sinop, band = "NDVI", class_cube = sinop_map)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.caption = "Leaflet visualization of classification of Sinop, MT, Brasil", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/view_sinop.png")
```
