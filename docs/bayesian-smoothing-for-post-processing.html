<p>Machine learning algorithms rely on training samples that are derived from “pure” pixels, hand-picked by users to represent the desired output classes. Given the presence of mixed pixels in images regardless of resolution, and the considerable data variability within each class, these classifiers often produce results with outliers or misclassified pixels. Therefore, post-processing techniques have become crucial to refine the labels of a classified image <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Huang2014">[80]</a></span>. Post-processing methods reduce salt-and-pepper and border effects, where single pixels or small groups of pixels are classified differently from their larger surrounding areas; these effects lead to visual discontinuity and inconsistency. By mitigating these errors and minimizing noise, post-processing improves the quality of the initial classification results, bringing a significant gain in the overall accuracy and interpretability of the final output <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Schindler2012">[81]</a></span>.</p>
<p>The <code>sits</code> package uses a <em>time-first, space-later</em> approach. Since machine learning classifiers in <code>sits</code> are mostly pixel-based, it is necessary to complement them with spatial smoothing methods. These methods improve the accuracy of land classification by incorporating spatial and contextual information into the classification process. The smoothing method available in <code>sits</code> uses an Empirical Bayes approach, adjusted to the specific properties of land classification. The assumption is that class probabilities at the local level should be similar and provide the baseline for comparison with the pixel values produced by the classifier. Based on these two elements, Bayesian smoothing adjusts the probabilities for the pixels, considering a spatial dependence.</p>

<h2>The need for post-processing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-need-for-post-processing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The main idea behind our post-processing method is that a pixel-based classification should take into account its neighborhood pixels. Consider the figure blow which shows a class assignment produced by a random forest algorithm on a image time series. The classified map has been produced by taking, for each pixel, the class of higher probability produced by the algorithm. The resulting map has many noisy areas with a high spatial variability of class assignments. This happens more frequently in two cases: (a) small clusters of pixels of one class inside a larger area of a different class; (b) transition zones between classes. In general, images of heterogeneous landscapes with high spatial variability have many mixed pixels, whose spectral response combines different types of land cover in a single ground resolved cell. For example, many pixels in the border between areas of classes <code>Forest</code> and
<code>Clear_Cut_Bare_Soil</code> are wrongly assigned to the <code>Clear_Cut_Vegetation</code> class. This wrong assignment occurs because these pixels have a mixed response. Inside the ground cell captured by the sensor as a single pixel value, there are both trees and bare soil areas. Such results are undesirable and need to be corrected by post-processing.</p>

</div>
<p>To maintain consistency and coherence in our class representations, we should minimise small variations or misclassifications. We incorporate spatial coherence as a post-processing step to accomplish this. The probabilities associated with each pixel will change based on statistical inference, which depends on the values for each neighbourhood. Using the recalculated probabilities for each pixel, we get a better version of the final classified map.</p>
<p>Consider the figure below, which is the result of Bayesian smoothing on the random forest algorithm outcomes. The noisy border pixels between two large areas of the same class have been removed. We have also removed small clusters of pixels belonging to one class inside larger areas of other classes. The outcome is a more uniform map, like the ones created through visual interpretation or object-based analysis. Details like narrow vegetation corridors or small forest roads might be missing in the smoothed image. However, the improved spatial consistency of the final map compensates for such losses, due to the removal of misclassified pixels that have mixed spectral responses.</p>

<h2>Empirical Bayesian estimation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#empirical-bayesian-estimation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The Bayesian estimate is based on the probabilities produced by the classifiers. Let <span class="math inline">\(p_{i,k} \geq 0\)</span> be the prior probability of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th pixel belonging to class <span class="math inline">\(k \in \{1, \ldots, m\}\)</span>. The probabilities <span class="math inline">\(p_{i,k}\)</span> are the classifier’s output, being subject to noise, outliers, and classification errors. Our estimation aims to remove these effects and obtain values that approximate the actual class probability better.</p>
<p>We convert the class probability values <span class="math inline">\(p_{i,k}\)</span> to log-odds values using the logit function, to transform probability values ranging from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to values from negative infinity to infinity. The conversion from probabilities logit values is helpful to support our assumption of normal distribution for our data.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    x_{i,k} = \ln \left(\frac{p_{i,k}}{1 - p_{i,k}}\right)
\]</span>
We assume that the logit of the prior probability of the pixels <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> associated to class <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is described by a Gaussian distribution function</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
x_{i,k} = \log\left( \frac{\pi_{i,k}}{1-\pi_{i,k}} \right) \sim N(m_{i,k}, s^2_{i,k})
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(m_{i,k}\)</span> represents the local mean value and <span class="math inline">\(s^2_{i,k}\)</span> the local class variance. The local mean and variance are computed based on the local neighborhood of the point. We express the likelihood as a conditional Gaussian distribution of the logit <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,k}\)</span> of the observed values <span class="math inline">\(p_{i,k}\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i,k}\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
(x_{i,k} | \mu_{i,k}) = \log(p_{i,k}/(1-p_{i,k})) \sim N(\mu_{i,k}, \sigma^2).
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>In the above equation, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i,k}\)</span> is the posterior expected mean of the logit probability associated to the <span class="math inline">\(i-th\)</span> pixel. The variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{k}\)</span> will be estimated based on user expertise and taken as a hyperparameter to control the smoothness of the resulting estimate. The standard Bayesian updating <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Gelman2014">[82]</a></span> leads to the posterior distribution which can be expressed as a weighted mean</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
{E}[\mu_{i,k} | x_{i,k}] =
\Biggl [ \frac{s^2_{i,k}}{\sigma^2_{k} +s^2_{i,k}} \Biggr ] \times
x_{i,k} +
\Biggl [ \frac{\sigma^2_{k}}{\sigma^2_{k} +s^2_{i,k}} \Biggr ] \times m_{i,k},
\]</span>
where:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(x_{i,k}\)</span> is the logit value for pixel <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and class <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(m_{i,k}\)</span> is the average of logit values for pixels of class <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
in the neighborhood of pixel <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(s^2_{i,k}\)</span> is the variance of logit values for pixels of class <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
in the neighborhood of pixel <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{k}\)</span> is an user-derived hyperparameter which estimates the variance for class <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, expressed in logits.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above equation is a weighted average between the value <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,k}\)</span> for the pixel and the mean <span class="math inline">\(m_{i,k}\)</span> for the neighboring pixels. When the variance <span class="math inline">\(s^2_{i,k}\)</span> for the neighbors is too high, the algorithm gives more weight to the pixel value <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,k}\)</span>. When class variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_k\)</span> increases, the results gives more weight to the neighborhood mean <span class="math inline">\(m_{i,k}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Bayesian smoothing for land classification assumes that image patches with similar characteristics have a dominant class. This dominant class has higher average probabilities and lower variance than other classes. A pixel assigned to a different class will likely exhibit high local variance in such regions. As a result, post-processing should adjust the class of this pixel to match the dominant class.</p>
<p>There is usually no prior information to specify <span class="math inline">\(m_{i,k}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s^2_{i,k}\)</span>. Because of that, we adopt an Empirical Bayes (EB) approach to obtain estimates of these prior parameters by considering the pixel neighborhood. However, using a standard symmetrical neighborhood for each pixel, based uniquely on the distance between locations, would not produce reasonable results for border pixels. For this reason, our EB estimates uses non-isotropic neighbourhood, as explained below.</p>
</div>
<div id="using-non-isotropic-neighborhoods" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Using non-isotropic neighborhoods<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-non-isotropic-neighborhoods"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The fundamental idea behind Bayesian smoothing for land classification is that individual pixels area related to those close to it. Each pixel usually has the same class as most of its neighbors. These closeness relations are expressed in similar values of class probability. If we find a pixel assigned to <code>Water</code> surrounded by pixels labeled as <code>Forest</code>, such pixel may have been wrongly labelled. To check if the pixel has been mislabeled, we look at the class probabilities for the pixels and its neighbors. There are possible situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The outlier has a class probability distribution very different from its neighbors. For example, its probability for belonging to the <code>Water</code> class is 80% while that of being a <code>Forest</code> is 20%. If we also consider that <code>Water</code> pixels have a smaller variance, since water areas have a strong signal in multispectral images, our post-processing method will not change the pixel’s label.</p></li>
<li><p>The outlier has a class probability distribution similar from its neighbors. Consider a case where a pixel has a 47% probability for <code>Water</code> and 43% probability for <code>Forest</code>. This small difference indicates that we need to look at the neighborhood to improve the information produced by the classifier. In these cases, the post-processing estimate may change the pixel’s label.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Pixels in the border between two areas of different classes pose a challenge. Only some of their neighbors belong to the same class as the pixel. To address this issue, we employ a non-isotropic definition of a neighborhood to estimate the prior class distribution. For instance, consider a boundary pixel with a neighborhood defined by a 7 x 7 window, located along the border between <code>Forest</code> and <code>Grassland</code> classes. To estimate the prior probability of the pixel being labeled as a <code>Forest</code>, we should only take into account the neighbors on one side of the border that are likely to be correctly classified as <code>Forest</code>. Pixels on the opposite side of the border should be disregarded, since they are unlikely to belong to the same spatial process. In practice, we use only half of the pixels in the 7 x 7 window, opting for those that have a higher probability of being named as <code>Forest</code>. For the prior probability of the <code>Grassland</code> class, we reverse the selection and only consider those on the opposite side of the border.</p>
<p>Although this choice of neighborhood may seem unconventional, it is consistent with the assumption of non-continuity of the spatial processes describing each class. A dense forest patch, for example, will have pixels with strong spatial autocorrelation for values of the Forest class; however, this spatial autocorrelation doesn’t extend across its border with other land classes.</p>

<div id="effect-of-the-hyperparameter" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Effect of the hyperparameter<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#effect-of-the-hyperparameter"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The parameter <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_k\)</span> controls the level of smoothness. If <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_k\)</span> is zero, the value <span class="math inline">\({E}[\mu_{i,k} | x_{i,k}]\)</span> will be equal to the pixel value <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,k}\)</span>. The parameter <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_k\)</span> expresses confidence in the inherent variability of the distribution of values of a class <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. The smaller the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_k\)</span>, the more we trust the estimated probability values produced by the classifier for class <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Conversely, higher values of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_k\)</span> indicate lower confidence in the classifier outputs and improved confidence in the local averages.</p>
<p>Consider the following two-class example. Take a pixel with probability <span class="math inline">\(0.4\)</span> (logit <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,1} = -0.4054\)</span>) for class A and probability <span class="math inline">\(0.6\)</span> (logit <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,2} = 0.4054\)</span>) for class B. Without post-processing, the pixel will be labeled as class B. Consider that the local average is <span class="math inline">\(0.6\)</span> (logit <span class="math inline">\(m_{i,1} = 0.4054\)</span>) for class A and <span class="math inline">\(0.4\)</span> (logit <span class="math inline">\(m_{i,2} = -0.4054\)</span>) for class B. This is a case of an outlier classified originally as class B in the midst of a set of class A pixels.</p>
<p>Given this situation, we apply the proposed method. Suppose the local variance of logits to be <span class="math inline">\(s^2_{i,1} = 5\)</span> for class A and <span class="math inline">\(s^2_{i,2} = 10\)</span> and for class B. This difference is to be expected if the local variability of class A is smaller than that of class B. To complete the estimate, we need to set the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{k}\)</span>, representing our belief in the variability of the probability values for each class.</p>
<p>Setting <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{k}\)</span> will be based on our confidence in the local variability of each class around pixel <span class="math inline">\({i}\)</span>. If we considered the local variability to be high, we can take both <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_1\)</span> for class A and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_2\)</span> for class B to be both 10. In this case, the Bayesian estimated probability for class A is <span class="math inline">\(0.52\)</span> and for class B is <span class="math inline">\(0.48\)</span> and the pixel will be relabeled as being class A.</p>
<p>By contrast, if we consider local variability to be high If we set <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> to be 5 for both classes A and B, the Bayesian probability estimate will be <span class="math inline">\(0.48\)</span> for class A and <span class="math inline">\(0.52\)</span> for class B. In this case, the original class will be kept. Therefore, the result is sensitive to the subjective choice of the hyperparameter. In the example below, we will show hoq to use the local logit variance to set the appropriate values of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>.</p>

<h2>Running Bayesian smoothing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#running-bayesian-smoothing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>We now show how to run Bayesian smoothing on a data cube covering an area of Sentinel-2 tile “20LLQ” in the period 2020-06-04 to 2021-08-26. The training data has six classes: (a) <code>Forest</code> for natural tropical forest; (b) <code>Water</code> for lakes and rivers; (c) “Wetlands” for areas where water covers the soil in the wet season; (d) <code>Clear_Cut_Burned_Area</code> for areas where fires cleared the land after tree removal; (e) <code>Clear_Cut_Bare_Soil</code> where the forest has been completely removed; (f) <code>Clear_Cut_Vegetation</code> where some vegetation remains after most trees have been removed. To simplify the example, our input is the probability cube generated by a random forest model. We recover the probability data cube and then plot the the results of the machine learning method for classes <code>Forest</code>, <code>Clear_Cut_Bare_Soil</code>, <code>Clear_Cut_Vegetation</code>, and <code>Clear_Cut_Burned_Area</code>.</p>

<p>The probability map for <code>Forest</code> shows high values associated with compact patches and linear stretches in riparian areas. Class <code>Clear_Cut_Bare_Soil</code> is mostly composed of dense areas of high probability whose geometrical boundaries result from forest cuts. Areas of class <code>Clear_Cut_Vegetation</code> are is less well-defined than the others; this is to be expected since this is a transitional class between a natural forest and areas of bare soil. Patches associated to class <code>Clear_Cut_Burned_Area</code> include both homogeneous areas of high probability and areas of mixed response. Since classes have different behaviours, the post-processing procedure should enable users to control how to handle outliers and border pixels of each class.</p>
<p>The next step is to show the labelled map resulting from the raw class probabilites. We produce a classification map by taking the class of higher probability to each pixel, without considering the spatial context. There are many places with the so-called “salt-and-pepper” effect which result from misclassified pixels. The non-smoothed labelled map shows the need for post-processing, since it contains a significant number of outliers and areas with mixed labelling.</p>

<h2>Assessing the local logit variance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assessing-the-local-logit-variance"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>To determine appropriate settings for the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{k}\)</span> hyperparameter for each class to perform Bayesian smoothing, it is useful to calculate the local logit variances for each class. For each pixel, we estimate the local variance <span class="math inline">\(s^2_{i,k}\)</span> by considering the non-isotropic neighborhood. The local logit variances are estimated by <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/sits/man/sits_variance.html">sits_variance()</a></code>; Its main parameters are: (a) <code>cube</code>, a probability data cube; (b) <code>window_size</code>, dimension of the local neighbourhood; (c) <code>neigh_fraction</code>, the percentage of pixels in the neighbourhood used to calculate the variance. The example below uses half of the pixels of a <span class="math inline">\(7\times 7\)</span> window to estimate the variance. The chosen pixels will be those with the highest probability pixels to be more representative of the actual class distribution. The output values are the logit variances in the vicinity of each pixel.</p>
<p>The choice of the <span class="math inline">\(7 \times 7\)</span> window size is a compromise between having enough values to estimate the parameters of a normal distribution and the need to capture local effects for class patches of small sizes. Classes such as <code>Water</code> tend to be spatially limited; a bigger window size could result in invalid values for their respective normal distributions.</p>

<p>Comparing the variance maps with the probability maps, one sees that areas of high probability of classes <code>Forest</code> and <code>Clear_Cut_Bare_Soil</code> are mostly made of compact patches. Recall these are the two dominant classes in the area, and deforestation is a process that converts forest to bare soil. Many areas of high logit variance for these classes are related to border pixels which have a mixed response. Areas of large patches of high logit variance for these classes are associated to lower class probabilities and will not be relevant to the final result.</p>
<p>By contrast, the transitional classes <code>Clear_Cut_Vegetation</code> and <code>Clear_Cut_Burned_Area</code> have a different spatial pattern of their probability and logit variance. The first has a high spatial variability, since pixels of this class arise when the forest has not been completely removed and there is some remaining vegetation after trees are cut. The extent of remaining vegetation after most trees have been removed is not uniform. For this reason, many areas of high local logit variance of class <code>Clear_Cut_Vegetation</code> are located in mixed patches inside pixels of class <code>Forest</code> and on the border between <code>Forest</code> and <code>Clear_Cut_Bare_Soil</code>. This situation is consistent with the earlier observation that transitional classes may appear as artificial effects of mixed pixels in borders between other classes.</p>
<p>Instances of class <code>ClearCut_Burned_Area</code> arise following a forest fire. Most pixels of this class tend to form mid-sized to large spatial clusters, because of how forest fires start and propagate. It is desirable to preserve the contiguity of the burned areas and remove pixels of other classes inside these clusters. Isolated points of class <code>ClearCut_Burned_Area</code> can be removed without significant information loss.</p>
<p>The distinct patterns of these classes are measured quantitatively by the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html">summary()</a></code> function. For variance cubes, this function provides information on the logit variance values of the higher inter-quartile values.</p>

<p>The summary statistics show that most local variance values are low, which is an expected result. Areas of low variance correspond to pixel neighborhoods of high logit values for one of the classes and low logit values for the others. High values of the local variances are relevant in areas of confusion between classes.</p>

<h2>Using the variance to select values of hyperparameters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-the-variance-to-select-values-of-hyperparameters"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>We make the following recommendations for setting the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{k}\)</span> parameter, based on the local logit variance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Set the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{k}\)</span> parameter with high values (in the 95%-100% range) to increase the neighborhood influence compared with the probability values for each pixel. Such choice will produce denser spatial clusters and remove “salt-and-pepper” outliers.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{k}\)</span> parameter with low values (in the 75%-80% range) to reduce the neighborhood influence, for classes that we want to preserve their original spatial shapes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the case of forest areas and watersheds. If an expert wishes to have compact areas classified as forests without many outliers inside them, she will set the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> parameter for the class <code>Forest</code> to be high. For comparison, to avoid that small watersheds with few similar neighbors being relabeled, it is advisable to avoid a strong influence of the neighbors, setting <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> to be as low as possible. In contrast, transitional classes such as <code>Clear_Cut_Vegetation</code> are likely to be associated with some outliers; use large <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{k}\)</span> for them.</p>
<p>To remove the outliers and classification errors, we run a smoothing procedure with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/sits/man/sits_smooth.html">sits_smooth()</a></code> with parameters: (a) <code>cube</code>, a probability cube produced by <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/sits/man/sits_classify.html">sits_classify()</a></code>; (b) <code>window_size</code>, the local window to compute the neighborhood probabilities; (d) <code>neigh_fraction</code>, fraction of local neighbors used to calculate local statistics; (e) <code>smoothness</code>, a vector with estimates of the prior variance of each class; (f) <code>multicores</code>, number of CPU cores that will be used for processing; (g) <code>memsize</code>, memory available for classification; (h) <code>output_dir</code>, a directory where results will be stored; (i) <code>version</code>, for version control. The resulting cube can be visualized with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html">plot()</a></code>.</p>
<p>The parameters <code>window_size</code> and <code>neigh_fraction</code> control how many pixels in a neighborhood the Bayesian estimator will use to calculate the local statistics. For example, setting <code>window size</code> to <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> and <code>neigh_fraction</code> to <span class="math inline">\(0.50\)</span> (the defaults) ensures that <span class="math inline">\(25\)</span> samples are used to estimate the local statistics. The <code>smoothness</code> values for the classes are set as recommended above.</p>

<p>Bayesian smoothing has removed some of the local variability associated with misclassified pixels that differ from their neighbors, specially in the case of transitional classes such as <code>Clear_Cut_Vegetation</code>. The smoothing impact is best appreciated by comparing the labeled map produced without smoothing to the one that follows the procedure, as shown below.</p>

<p>In the smoothed map, outliers inside forest areas and in the class borders have been removed. The salt-and-pepper effect associated to transitional classes has also been replaced by more coherent estimates. The smoothed map shown much improvements compared with the non-smoothed one. In conclusion, post-processing is a desirable step in any classification process. Bayesian smoothing improves the borders between the objects created by the classification and removes outliers that result from pixel-based classification. It is a reliable method that should be used in most situations.</p>
