# Satellite Image Time Series

The `sits` package uses sets of time series data describing properties in spatiotemporal locations of interest. For land classification, these sets consist of samples labeled by experts. The package can also be used for any type of classification, provided that the timeline and bands of the time series used for training match that of the data cubes. 

The quality of training data is critical to improving the accuracy of maps resulting from machine learning classification methods. To address this challenge, the `sits` package provides three methods for improving training samples. For large datasets, we recommend using both imbalance-reducing and SOM-based algorithms. The SOM-based method identifies potential mislabeled samples and outliers that require further investigation. The results demonstrate a positive impact on the overall classification accuracy.

The complexity and diversity of our planet defy simple label names with hard boundaries. Due to representational and data handling issues, all classification systems have a limited number of categories, which inevitably fail to adequately describe the nuances of the planet's landscapes. All representation systems are thus limited and application-dependent. As stated by Janowicz [@Janowicz2012]: "geographical concepts are situated and context-dependent and can be described from different, equally valid, points of view; thus, ontological commitments are arbitrary to a large extent". 

The availability of big data and satellite image time series is a further challenge. In principle, image time series can capture more subtle changes for land classification. Experts must conceive classification systems and training data collections by understanding how time series information relates to actual land change. Methods for quality analysis, such as those presented in this Part, cannot replace user understanding and informed choices.
