# Introduction

## Who is this book for?

This book, tailored for land use change experts and researchers, is a practical guide that enables them to analyze big Earth observation data sets. It provides readers with the means of producing high-quality maps of land use and land cover, guiding them through all the steps to achieve good results. Given the natural world's complexity and huge variations in human-nature interactions, only local experts who know their countries and ecosystems can extract full information from big EO data.

One group of readers that we are keen to engage with is the national authorities on forest, agriculture, and statistics in developing countries. We aim to foster a collaborative environment where they can use EO data to enhance their national land use and cover estimates, supporting sustainable development policies. To achieve this goal, `sits` has strong backing from the FAO Expert Group on the Use of Earth Observation data ([FAO-EOSTAT](https://www.fao.org/in-action/eostat)). FAO-EOSTAT is at the forefront of using advanced EO data analysis methods for agricultural statistics in developing countries [@DeSimone2022; @DeSimone2022a].

## Why work with satellite image time series?

Satellite imagery provides the most extensive data on our environment. By encompassing vast areas of the Earth's surface, images enable researchers to analyze local and worldwide transformations. By observing the same location multiple times, satellites provide data on environmental changes and survey areas that are difficult to observe from the ground. Given its unique features, images offer essential information for many applications, including deforestation, crop production, food security, urban footprints, water scarcity, and land degradation. Using time series, experts improve their understanding of ecological patterns and processes. Instead of selecting individual images from specific dates and comparing them, researchers track change continuously [@Woodcock2020].

## Time-first, space-later

"Time-first, space-later" is a concept in satellite image classification that takes time series analysis as the first step for analyzing remote sensing data, with spatial information being considered after all time series are classified. The *time-first* part brings a better understanding of changes in landscapes. Detecting and tracking seasonal and long-term trends becomes feasible, as well as identifying anomalous events or patterns in the data, such as wildfires, floods, or droughts. Each pixel in a data cube is treated as a time series, using information available in the temporal instances of the case. Time series classification is pixel-based, producing a set of labeled pixels. This result is then used as input to the *space-later* part of the method. In this phase, a smoothing algorithm improves the results of time-first classification by considering the spatial neighborhood of each pixel. The resulting map thus combines both spatial and temporal information.

## Land use and land cover

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization defines land cover as "the observed biophysical cover on the Earth's surface" [@DiGregorio2016]. Land cover can be observed and mapped directly through remote sensing images. In FAO's guidelines and reports, land use is described as "the human activities or purposes for which land is managed or exploited". Although *land cover* and *land use* denote different approaches for describing the Earth's landscape, in practice there is considerable overlap between these concepts [@Comber2008b]. When classifying remote sensing images, natural areas are classified using land cover types (e.g, forest), while human-modified areas are described with land use classes (e.g., pasture).

One of the advantages of using image time series for land classification is its capacity of measuring changes in the landscape related to agricultural practices. For example, the time series of a vegetation index in an area of crop production will show a pattern of minima (planting and sowing stages) and maxima (flowering stage). Thus, classification schemas based on image time series data can be richer and more detailed than those associated only with land cover. In what follows, we use the term "land classification" to refer to image classification representing both land cover and land use classes.

## How `sits` works

The `sits` package uses satellite image time series for land classification, using a *time-first, space-later* approach. In the data preparation part, collections of big Earth observation images are organized as data cubes. Each spatial location of a data cube is associated with a time series. Locations with known labels train a machine learning algorithm, which classifies all time series of a data cube, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:gview).

```{r gview, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", out.height = "70%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Using time series for land classification (source: authors)."}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/sits_general_view.png")
```

The package provides tools for analysis, visualization, and classification of satellite image time series. Users follow a typical workflow for a pixel-based classification:

1.  Select an analysis-ready data image collection from a cloud provider such as AWS, Microsoft Planetary Computer, Digital Earth Africa, or Brazil Data Cube.
2.  Build a regular data cube using the chosen image collection.
3.  Obtain new bands and indices with operations on data cubes.
4.  Extract time series samples from the data cube to be used as training data.
5.  Perform quality control and filtering on the time series samples.
6.  Train a machine learning model using the time series samples.
7.  Classify the data cube using the model to get class probabilities for each pixel.
8.  Post-process the probability cube to remove outliers.
9.  Produce a labeled map from the post-processed probability cube.
10. Evaluate the accuracy of the classification using best practices.

Each workflow step corresponds to a function of the `sits` API, as shown in the Table below and Figure \@ref(fig:api). These functions have convenient default parameters and behaviors. A single function builds machine learning (ML) models. The classification function processes big data cubes with efficient parallel processing. Since the `sits` API is simple to learn, achieving good results do not require in-depth knowledge about machine learning and parallel processing.

Additionally, experts can perform object-based image analysis (OBIA) with `sits`. In this case, before classifying the time series, one can use `sits_segments()` to create a set of closed polygons. These polygons are classified using a subset of the time series contained inside each segment. For details, see Chapter [Object-based time series image analysis](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/object-based-time-series-image-analysis.html).
