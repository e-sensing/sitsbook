## Community Contributions {.unnumbered}

The authors thank the R-spatial community for their foundational work, including Marius Appel, Tim Appelhans, Robert Hijmans, Jakub Nowosad, Edzer Pebesma, and Martijn Tennekes for their R packages `gdalcubes`,  `leafem`, `terra`, `supercells`, `sf`/`stars`, and `tmap`. We are grateful for the work of Dirk Eddelbuettel on `Rcpp` and `RcppArmadillo` and Ron Wehrens in package `kohonen`. We are much indebted to Hadley Wickham for the `tidyverse`, Daniel Falbel for the `torch` and `luz` packages, and the RStudio team for package `leaflet`. The multiple authors of machine learning packages `randomForest`, `e1071`, and `xgboost` provided robust algorithms. We would like to thank Python developers who shared their deep learning algorithms for image time series classification: Vivien Sainte Fare Garnot, Zhiguang Wang, Maja Schneider, and Marc Rußwurm.
