Selecting good training samples for machine learning classification of satellite images is critical to achieving accurate results. Experience with machine learning methods has shown that the number and quality of training samples are crucial factors in obtaining accurate results [@Maxwell2018]. Large and accurate datasets are preferable, regardless of the algorithm used, while noisy training samples can negatively impact classification performance [@Frenay2014]. Thus, it is beneficial to use pre-processing methods to improve the quality of samples and eliminate those that may have been incorrectly labeled or possess low discriminatory power.

It is necessary to distinguish between wrongly labeled samples and differences resulting from the natural variability of class signatures. When working in a large geographic region, the variability of vegetation phenology leads to different patterns being assigned to the same label. A related issue is the limitation of crisp boundaries to describe the natural world. Class definitions use idealized descriptions (e.g., "a savanna woodland has tree cover of 50% to 90% ranging from 8 to 15 m in height"). Class boundaries are fuzzy and sometimes overlap, making it hard to distinguish between them. To improve sample quality, `sits` provides methods for evaluating the training data.

Given a set of training samples, experts should first cross-validate the training set to assess their inherent prediction error. The results show whether the data is internally consistent. Since cross-validation does not predict actual model performance, this chapter provides additional tools for improving the quality of training sets. More detailed information is available on Chapter [Validation and accuracy measurements](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/validation-and-accuracy-measurements.html).

## Datasets used in this chapter{-}

The examples of this chapter use two datasets: 

-  `cerrado_2classes`: a set of time series for the Cerrado region of Brazil, the second largest biome in South America with an area of more than 2 million km^2. The data contains 746 samples divided into 2 classes (`Cerrado` and `Pasture`). Each time series covers 12 months (23 data points) from MOD13Q1 product, and has 2 bands (EVI, and NDVI).

- `samples_cerrado_mod13q1`: a set of time series from the Cerrado region of Brazil. The data ranges from 2000 to 2017 and includes 50,160 samples divided into 12 classes (`Dense_Woodland`, `Dunes`, `Fallow_Cotton`,  `Millet_Cotton`, `Pasture`, `Rocky_Savanna`, `Savanna`, `Savanna_Parkland`, `Silviculture`, `Soy_Corn`, `Soy_Cotton`, and  `Soy_Fallow`). Each time series covers 12 months (23 data points) from MOD13Q1 product, and has 4 bands (EVI, NDVI, MIR, and NIR). We use bands NDVI and EVI for faster processing.

```{r, tidy = "styler"}
library(sits)
library(sitsdata)
# Take only the NDVI and EVI bands
samples_cerrado_mod13q1_2bands <- sits_select(
    data = samples_cerrado_mod13q1, 
    bands = c("NDVI", "EVI"))

# Show the summary of the samples
summary(samples_cerrado_mod13q1_2bands)
```


## Cross-validation of training sets{-}

Cross-validation is a technique to estimate the inherent prediction error of a model [@Hastie2009]. Since cross-validation uses only the training samples, its results are not accuracy measures unless the samples have been carefully collected to represent the diversity of possible occurrences of classes in the study area [@Wadoux2021]. In practice, when working in large areas, it is hard to obtain random stratified samples which cover the different variations in land classes associated with the ecosystems of the study area. Thus, cross-validation should be taken as a measure of model performance on the training data and not an estimate of overall map accuracy. 

Cross-validation uses part of the available samples to fit the classification model and a different part to test it. The k-fold validation method splits the data into $k$ partitions with approximately the same size and proceeds by fitting the model and testing it $k$ times. At each step, we take one distinct partition for the test and the remaining ${k-1}$ for training the model and calculate its prediction error for classifying the test partition. A simple average gives us an estimation of the expected prediction error. The recommended choices of $k$ are $5$ or $10$ [@Hastie2009].

`sits_kfold_validate()` supports k-fold validation in `sits`. The result is the confusion matrix and the accuracy statistics (overall and by class). In the examples below, we use multiprocessing to speed up the results. The parameters of `sits_kfold_validate` are:

1. `samples`:  training samples organized as a time series tibble;
2. `folds`: number of folds, or how many times to split the data (default = 5);
3. `ml_method`: ML/DL method to be used for the validation (default = random forest);
4. `multicores`: number of cores to be used for parallel processing (default = 2).

Below we show an example of cross-validation on the `samples_cerrado_mod13q1` dataset. 

```{r, tidy = "styler"}
rfor_validate <- sits_kfold_validate(
    samples = samples_cerrado_mod13q1_2bands,
    folds = 5,
    ml_method = sits_rfor(),
    multicores = 5
)
rfor_validate
```

The results show a good validation, reaching 94% accuracy. However, this accuracy does not guarantee a good classification result. It only shows if the training data is internally consistent. In what follows, we present additional methods for improving sample quality.

Cross-validation measures how well the model fits the training data. Using these results to measure classification accuracy is only valid if the training data is a good sample of the entire dataset. Training data is subject to various sources of bias. In land classification, some classes are much more frequent than others, so the training dataset will be imbalanced.  Regional differences in soil and climate conditions for large areas will lead the same classes to have different spectral responses. Field analysts may be restricted to places they have access (e.g., along roads) when collecting samples. An additional problem is mixed pixels. Expert interpreters select samples that stand out in fieldwork or reference images. Border pixels are unlikely to be chosen as part of the training data. For all these reasons, cross-validation results do not measure classification accuracy for the entire dataset. 

## Hierarchical clustering for sample quality control{-}

The package provides two clustering methods to assess sample quality: Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) and Self-organizing Maps (SOM). These methods have different computational complexities. AHC has a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, given the number of time series $n$, whereas SOM complexity is linear. For large data, AHC requires substantial memory and running time; in these cases, SOM is recommended. This section describes how to run AHC in `sits`. The SOM-based technique is presented in the next section.

AHC computes the dissimilarity between any two elements from a dataset. Depending on the distance functions and linkage criteria, the algorithm decides which two clusters are merged at each iteration. This approach is helpful for exploring samples due to its visualization power and ease of use [@Keogh2003]. In `sits`, AHC is implemented using `sits_cluster_dendro()`.

```{r cludendro, tidy = "styler", cache = TRUE, fig.align="center", out.width="90%", fig.cap="Example of hierarchical clustering for a two class set of time series (source: authors).", message=FALSE}
# Take a set of patterns for 2 classes
# Create a dendrogram, plot, and get the optimal cluster based on ARI index
clusters <- sits_cluster_dendro(
    samples = cerrado_2classes, 
    bands = c("NDVI", "EVI"),
    dist_method = "dtw_basic",
    linkage =  "ward.D2")
```

The `sits_cluster_dendro()` function has one mandatory parameter (`samples`), with the samples to be evaluated. Optional parameters include `bands`, `dist_method`, and `linkage`. The `dist_method` parameter specifies how to calculate the distance between two time series. We recommend a metric that uses dynamic time warping (DTW) [@Petitjean2012], as DTW is a reliable method for measuring differences between satellite image time series [@Maus2016]. The options available in `sits` are based on those provided by package `dtwclust`, which include `dtw_basic`, `dtw_lb`, and `dtw2`. Please check `?dtwclust::tsclust` for more information on DTW distances.

The `linkage` parameter defines the distance metric between clusters. The recommended linkage criteria are: `complete` or `ward.D2`. Complete linkage prioritizes the within-cluster dissimilarities, producing clusters with shorter distance samples, but results are sensitive to outliers. As an alternative, Ward proposes to use the sum-of-squares error to minimize data variance [@Ward1963]; his method is available as `ward.D2` option to the `linkage` parameter.  To cut the dendrogram, the `sits_cluster_dendro()` function computes the adjusted rand index (ARI) [@Rand1971], returning the height where the cut of the dendrogram maximizes the index. In the example, the ARI index indicates that there are six clusters. The result of `sits_cluster_dendro()` is a time series tibble with one additional column called "cluster". The function `sits_cluster_frequency()` provides information on the composition of each cluster.

```{r}
# Show clusters samples frequency
sits_cluster_frequency(clusters)
```

The cluster frequency table shows that each cluster has a predominance of either `Cerrado` or `Pasture` labels, except for cluster 3, which has a mix of samples from both labels. Such confusion may have resulted from incorrect labeling, inadequacy of selected bands and spatial resolution, or even a natural confusion due to the variability of the land classes. To remove cluster 3, use `dplyr::filter()`. The resulting clusters still contain mixed labels, possibly resulting from outliers. In this case, `sits_cluster_clean()` removes the outliers, leaving only the most frequent label. After cleaning the samples, the resulting set of samples is likely to improve the classification results.

```{r}
# Remove cluster 3 from the samples
clusters_new <- dplyr::filter(clusters, cluster != 3)
# Clear clusters, leaving only the majority label
clean <- sits_cluster_clean(clusters_new)
# Show clusters samples frequency
sits_cluster_frequency(clean)
```


## Using SOM for sample quality control{-}

<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/esensing/using-som-for-sample-quality-control-in-sits" target="_blank"><img src="https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg"></a>

`sits` provides a clustering technique based on self-organizing maps (SOM) as an alternative to hierarchical clustering for quality control of training samples. SOM is a dimensionality reduction technique [@Kohonen1990], where high-dimensional data is mapped into a two-dimensional map, keeping the topological relations between data patterns. As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:som2d), the SOM 2D map is composed of units called neurons. Each neuron has a weight vector, with the same dimension as the training samples. At the start, neurons are assigned a small random value and then trained by competitive learning. The algorithm computes the distances of each member of the training set to all neurons and finds the neuron closest to the input, called the best matching unit.

```{r som2d, out.width = "90%", out.height = "90%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="SOM 2D map creation (Source: Santos et al. (2021). Reproduction under fair use doctrine)."}

knitr::include_graphics("./images/som_structure.png")
```

The input data for quality assessment is a set of training samples, which are high-dimensional data; for example, a time series with 25 instances of 4 spectral bands has 100 dimensions. When projecting a high-dimensional dataset into a 2D SOM map, the units of the map (called neurons) compete for each sample. Each time series will be mapped to one of the neurons. Since the number of neurons is smaller than the number of classes, each neuron will be associated with many time series. The resulting 2D map will be a set of clusters. Given that SOM preserves the topological structure of neighborhoods in multiple dimensions, clusters that contain training samples with a given label will usually be neighbors in 2D space. The neighbors of each neuron of a SOM map provide information on intraclass and interclass variability, which is used to detect noisy samples. The methodology of using SOM for sample quality assessment is discussed in detail in the reference paper [@Santos2021a].

```{r clusommet, out.width = "90%", out.height = "90%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Using SOM for class noise reduction (Source: Santos et al. (2021). Reproduction under fair use doctrine)."}

knitr::include_graphics("./images/methodology_bayes_som.png")
```


## Creating the SOM map{-}

To perform the SOM-based quality assessment, the first step is to run `sits_som_map()`, which uses the `kohonen` R package to compute a SOM grid [@Wehrens2018], controlled by five parameters. The grid size is given by `grid_xdim` and `grid_ydim`. The starting learning rate is `alpha`, which decreases during the interactions. To measure the separation between samples, use `distance` (either "dtw" or "euclidean"). The number of iterations is set by `rlen`. When using `sits_som_map()` in machines which have multiprocessing support for the OpenMP protocol, setting the laerning mode parameter `mode` to "patch" improves processing time. In MacOS and Windows, please use "online". 

We suggest using the Dynamic Time Warping ("dtw") metric as the distance measure. It is a technique used to measure the similarity between two temporal sequences that may vary in speed or timing [@Berndt1994]. The core idea of DTW is to find the optimal alignment between two sequences by allowing non-linear mapping of one sequence onto another. In time series analysis, DTW matches two series slightly out of sync. This property is useful in land use studies for matching time series of agricultural areas [@Maus2015].

```{r, tidy = "styler", echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Clustering time series using SOM
som_cluster <- sits_som_map(samples_cerrado_mod13q1_2bands,
    grid_xdim = 15,
    grid_ydim = 15,
    alpha = 1.0,
    distance = "dtw",
    rlen = 20)
```

```{r, tidy = "styler", echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
# Recover SOM cluster from RDS file
library(sits)
library(kohonen)
som_cluster <- readRDS(file = "./etc/som_cluster.rds")
```



```{r clusommap, tidy = "styler", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "SOM map for the Cerrado samples (source: authors)."}
# Plot the SOM map
plot(som_cluster)
```

The output of the `sits_som_map()` is a list with three elements: (a) `data`, the original set of time series with two additional columns for each time series: `id_sample` (the original id of each sample) and `id_neuron` (the id of the neuron to which it belongs); (b) `labelled_neurons`, a tibble with information on the neurons. For each neuron, it gives the prior and posterior probabilities of all labels which occur in the samples assigned to it; and (c) the SOM grid. To plot the SOM grid, use `plot()`. The neurons are labelled using majority voting.

The SOM grid shows that most classes are associated with neurons close to each other, although there are exceptions. Some Pasture neurons are far from the main cluster because the transition between open savanna and pasture areas is not always well defined and depends on climate and latitude. Also, the neurons associated with Soy_Fallow are dispersed in the map, indicating possible problems in distinguishing this class from the other agricultural classes. The SOM map can be used to remove outliers, as shown below.

## Measuring confusion between labels using SOM{-}

The second step in SOM-based quality assessment is understanding the confusion between labels. The function `sits_som_evaluate_cluster()` groups neurons by their majority label and produces a tibble. Neurons are grouped into clusters, and there will be as many clusters as there are labels. The results shows the percentage of samples of each label in each cluster. Ideally, all samples of each cluster would have the same label. In practice, cluster contain samples with different label. This information helps on measuring the confusion between samples. 

```{r}
# Produce a tibble with a summary of the mixed labels
som_eval <- sits_som_evaluate_cluster(som_cluster)
# Show the result
som_eval 
```

Many labels are associated with clusters where there are some samples with a different label. Such confusion between labels arises because sample labeling is subjective and can be biased. In many cases, interpreters use high-resolution data to identify samples. However, the actual images to be classified are captured by satellites with lower resolution. In our case study, a MOD13Q1 image has pixels with 250 m resolution. As such, the correspondence between labeled locations in high-resolution images and mid to low-resolution images is not direct. The confusion by sample label can be visualized in a bar plot using `plot()`, as shown below. The bar plot shows some confusion between the labels associated with the natural vegetation typical of the Brazilian Cerrado (`Savanna`, `Savanna_Parkland`, `Rocky_Savanna`). This mixture is due to the large variability of the natural vegetation of the Cerrado biome, which makes it difficult to draw sharp boundaries between classes. Some confusion is also visible between the agricultural classes. The `Millet_Cotton` class is a particularly difficult one since many of the samples assigned to this class are confused with `Soy_Cotton` and `Fallow_Cotton`. 

```{r clusomeval, out.width = "90%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Confusion between classes as measured by SOM (source: authors)."}
# Plot the confusion between clusters
plot(som_eval)
```

## Detecting noisy samples using SOM{-}

The third step in the quality assessment uses the discrete probability distribution associated with each neuron, which is included in the `labeled_neurons` tibble produced by `sits_som_map()`. This approach associates probabilities with frequency of occurrence. More homogeneous neurons (those with one label has high frequency) are assumed to be composed of good quality samples. Heterogeneous neurons (those with two or more classes with significant frequencies) are likely to contain noisy samples. The algorithm computes two values for each sample:

- *prior probability*: the probability that the label assigned to the sample is correct, considering the frequency of samples in the same neuron. For example, if a neuron has 20 samples, of which 15 are labeled as `Pasture` and 5 as `Forest`, all samples labeled Forest are assigned a prior probability of 25%. This indicates that Forest samples in this neuron may not be of good quality.

- *posterior probability*: the probability that the label assigned to the sample is correct, considering the neighboring neurons. Take the case of the above-mentioned neuron whose samples labeled `Pasture` have a prior probability of 75%. What happens if all the neighboring neurons have `Forest` as a majority label? To answer this question, we use Bayesian inference to estimate if these samples are noisy based on the surrounding neurons [@Santos2021]. 

To identify noisy samples, we take the result of the `sits_som_map()` function as the first argument to the function `sits_som_clean_samples()`. This function finds out which samples are noisy, which are clean, and which need to be further examined by the user. It requires the `prior_threshold` and `posterior_threshold` parameters according to the following rules:

-   If the prior probability of a sample is less than `prior_threshold`, the sample is assumed to be noisy and tagged as "remove";
-   If the prior probability is greater or equal to `prior_threshold` and the posterior probability calculated by Bayesian inference is greater or equal to `posterior_threshold`, the sample is assumed not to be noisy and thus is tagged as "clean";
-   If the prior probability is greater or equal to `prior_threshold` and the posterior probability is less than `posterior_threshold`, we have a situation when the sample is part of the majority level of those assigned to its neuron, but its label is not consistent with most of its neighbors. This is an anomalous condition and is tagged as "analyze". Users are encouraged to inspect such samples to find out whether they are in fact noisy or not.

The default value for both `prior_threshold` and `posterior_threshold` is 60%. The `sits_som_clean_samples()` has an additional parameter (`keep`), which indicates which samples should be kept in the set based on their prior and posterior probabilities. The default for `keep` is `c("clean", "analyze")`. As a result of the cleaning, about 900 samples have been considered to be noisy and thus removed.

```{r, tidy = "styler", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
new_samples <- sits_som_clean_samples(
    som_map = som_cluster, 
    prior_threshold = 0.6,
    posterior_threshold = 0.6,
    keep = c("clean", "analyze"))
# Print the new sample distribution
summary(new_samples)
```

All samples of the class which had the highest confusion with others(`Millet_Cotton`) have been removed. Most samples of class `Silviculture` (planted forests) have also been removed since they have been confused with natural forests and woodlands in the SOM map. Further analysis includes calculating the SOM map and confusion matrix for the new set, as shown in the following example. 

```{r, tidy = "styler", eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Evaluate the mixture in the SOM clusters of new samples
library(sits)
library(kohonen)
new_cluster <- readRDS("./etc/new_cluster.rds")
```

```{r, tidy = "styler", eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Evaluate the mixture in the SOM clusters of new samples
new_cluster <- sits_som_map(
   data = new_samples,
   grid_xdim = 15,
   grid_ydim = 15,
   alpha = 1.0,
   rlen = 20,
   distance = "dtw")
```

```{r clumix, out.width="90%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Cluster confusion plot for samples cleaned by SOM (source: authors)."}
new_cluster_mixture <- sits_som_evaluate_cluster(new_cluster)
# Plot the mixture information.
plot(new_cluster_mixture)
```

As expected, the new confusion map shows a significant improvement over the previous one. This result should be interpreted carefully since it may be due to different effects. The most direct interpretation is that `Millet_Cotton` and `Silviculture` cannot be easily separated from the other classes, given the current attributes (a time series of NDVI and EVI indices from MODIS images). In such situations, users should consider improving the number of samples from the less represented classes, including more MODIS bands, or working with higher resolution satellites. The results of the SOM method should be interpreted based on the users' understanding of the ecosystems and agricultural practices of the study region. 


The SOM-based analysis discards samples that can be confused with samples of other classes. After removing noisy samples or uncertain classes, the dataset obtains a better validation score since there is less confusion between classes. Users should analyse the results with care. Not all discarded samples are low-quality ones. Confusion between samples of different classes can result from inconsistent labeling or from the lack of capacity of satellite data to distinguish between chosen classes. When many samples are discarded, as in the current example, revising the whole classification schema is advisable. The aim of selecting training data should always be to match the reality on the ground to the power of remote sensing data to identify differences. No analysis procedure can replace actual user experience and knowledge of the study region.
