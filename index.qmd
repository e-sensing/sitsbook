Welcome to the age of big Earth observation data! Petabytes of images are now openly accessible in cloud services. With free access to massive data sets, we need new methods to measure change on our planet using image data. An essential contribution of big EO data has been to provide access to image time series that capture signals from the same locations continually. Time series are a powerful tool for monitoring change, providing insights and information that single snapshots cannot achieve. Better measurement of natural resource depletion caused by deforestation, forest degradation, and desertification is possible. Experts improve the production of agricultural statistics. Using image time series, analysts can use large data collections to detect subtle changes in ecosystem health and distinguish between various land classes more effectively. Time series analysis is an innovative way to address global challenges like climate change, biodiversity preservation, and sustainable agriculture.

This book introduces `sits`, an open-source **R** package for big Earth observation data analysis using satellite image time series. Users build regular data cubes from cloud services such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Planetary Computer, Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel, Brazil Data Cube, Swiss Data Cube, Digital Earth Australia, and Digital Earth Africa. The `sits` API includes training sample quality measures, machine learning and deep learning classification algorithms, and Bayesian post-processing methods for smoothing and uncertainty assessment. To evaluate results, sits supports best-practice accuracy assessments. The authors also provide a **Python** API that interfaces with the **R** API, and thus allows Python users to directly run sits and convert sits data structures to Python data.frames and xarrays.


## How much R knowledge is required?{-}

The `sits` package is designed for remote sensing experts in the Earth Sciences field who want to use advanced data analysis techniques with only basic programming knowledge. The package provides a clear and direct set of functions that are easy to learn and master. To quickly master what is needed to run sits, please read Parts 1 and 2 of Garrett Grolemund’s book, [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/). Although not needed to run `sits`, your **R** skills will benefit from the book by Hadley Wickham and Gareth Grolemund, [R for Data Science (2nd edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). Important concepts of spatial analysis are presented by Edzer Pebesma and Roger Bivand in their book [Spatial Data Science](https://r-spatial.org/book/).


## How does one run SITS in Python?{-}

From version 1.5.3 onwards, users can run `sits` in Python. Follow the instructions in the “Setup” chapter on how to set your Python environment to interface with R. Then follow the book examples provided for using `sits` in Python. The book provides code in both R and Python. Therefore, after correctly setting up their working environment, Python experts can run sits functions in their favorite tools, such as Jupyter Notebooks.
