### Contents of this repository

This repository contains Rmarkdown (.Rmd) files with the text of the book "Satellite Image Time Series Analysis on Earth Observation Data Cubes", which describes the `sits` package and also provides a conceptual background on the subject of big Earth observation data analysis,

### Overview of sits

`sits` is an open source R package for satellite image time series analysis. It enables users to apply machine learning techniques for classifying image time series obtained from earth observation data cubes. The package is available on [github](https://github.com/e-sensing/sits) and provides tools for analysis, visualization, and classification of satellite image time series.
