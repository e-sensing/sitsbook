title: "Supporting STAC-based ARD catalogs"

If you want to include a STAC-based catalogue not yet supported by `sits`, we encourage you to look at existing implementations of catalogues such as Microsoft Planetary Computer (MPC), Digital Earth Africa (DEA) and AWS. STAC-based catalogues in `sits` are associated to YAML description files, which are available in the directory `.inst/exdata/sources`. For example, the YAML file `config_source_mpc.yml` describes the contents of the MPC collections supported by `sits`. Please first provide an YAML file which lists the detailed contents of the new catalogue you wish to include. Follow the examples provided.

After writing the YAML file, you need to consider how to access and query the new catalogue. The entry point for access to all catalogues is the `sits_cube.stac_cube()` function, which in turn calls a sequence of functions which are described in the generic interface `api_source.R`. Most calls of this API are handled by the functions of `api_source_stac.R` which provides an interface to the `rstac` package and handles STAC queries.

Each STAC catalogue is different. The STAC specification allows providers to implement their data descriptions with specific information. For this reason, the generic API described in `api_source.R` needs to be specialized for each provider. Whenever a provider needs specific implementations of parts of the STAC protocol, we include them in separate files. For example, `api_source_mpc.R` implements specific quirks of the MPC platform. Similarly, specific support for CDSE (Copernicus Data Space Environment) is available in `api_source_cdse.R`.
